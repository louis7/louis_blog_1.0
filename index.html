        <p class="font-weight-light"> It all stated on a late Friday night in Miami with me laying on my bed, staring at the ceiling, heavy rain pouring outside, with a faint sound of latin music playing from my cuban neighbor next door.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">I was trying to solve a simple coding problem from this free online coding class that I took: how to I implement a loop to shift a given character in an array by X amount of place. </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">It was an introduction of the Cesar Cypher, a method introduced by Julius Cesar, encrypts a message by shifting around the individual charaters in that letter by a specific pattern that only the sender and recipient would know.  </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">While you may be thinking that a beginner should not be dabbling into developing encryption schemes as their first intro to programming, but that problem truly was an introductory to loop methods and array. Tooks me 4 days to implement that simple loop that would solve that problem -- it felt Glorious and I was hooked ever since, that was 2 years ago!</p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">Fast forward to now, I am doing Flatiron online community bootcamp.For my First <a href="https://github.com/louis7/DoeItWork2">major project</a>, I decide to address a common problem I see people are facing: How do would one know my their iPhone XS will work 4G/LTE speed in my contry?
          different contries used different bands and the iPhones dont include all the 4g bands. Well, using object oriented programming approach with capabilities of gathering data from external data source (scrapping) by using tools like nokogiri, regular expression, and tracking it all using git may help. </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light"> It's been an interesting journey, and Flatiron School has challenge my thinking and unlock my creativity. Here is the 3 things I learned doing this CLI project:
        </p>

        <p>     </p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1433162653888-a571db5ccccf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="">

        <p class=" font-weight-italic"> I am calm, I am calm, I am calm ... I think.</p>


       <h7 class=" font-weight-bold"> 1 - Start with a crystal clear vision of what your application will do:</h7>
<p>     </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">As a programmer, it became apparent early on that the more you code, the more preparation and critical thinking you will have to do before you even write the software.  </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">Which seems a bit counterintuitive to me at first because I was always eager to just start writing the code. But too often, if the end goal is not clear, the software end up been bloated, and wasteful in the approach. </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">So now, as a rule, I code from the top down, always ask myself: what is the ideal code I wish I had to solve the particular problem I am trying to solve. What would I would like the program to easily do? Asking these question will give you a clearer picture on what the software will end up as.</p>

        <h7 class="font-weight-light font-weight-bold"> 2 - Know when you create a class instead adding a complex method:</h7>
        <p>     </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light"> While I am relatively new to Object Oriented Programming, I did pick up a few approaches that made my life easier. For instance, when is it appropriate to create a class or simply add a few method within an existing class? </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">I think a rule of thumb is if within a class you have methods that responsibilities are drastically different than the other instance/class methods than you should package these functions together into a separate class. Makes for cleaner code, easier to read and faster debug.</p>

        <h7 class=" font-weight-bold">3 - Have milestones and keep solving problems.</h7>
        <p>     </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">There were many time in my code where an error or bug pops up and I have zero clue on what and how to solve the problem. And StackOverflow is not always going to help. </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light"> The first thing I would advice after multiple failed attempts at trying to solve any bug or implementation problem is to pause. </p>

        <p>     </p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">Take a break, watch a movie, work on a different section of your code, do anything to take your mind off the initial problem. After giving your mind enough time to rest, you can look at it with fresh eyes. 9 out of 10, you will solve your problem.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">  Last, while we solving all of those problems, it is important to keep score. There is this great feeling of scratching off your notepad an list of problem that you previously were not sure if you were able to solve. It a great psychological boost and great sense of accomplishment. And most important of all, it shows a progression.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">Hopefully, those beginners lessons I have acquired may be of any use to any of you who are looking to start learning to code. Until next time.</p>
